# Agent High-Risk Decision Log

This log is mandatory in `unrestricted_senior` mode.

Use one entry per high-risk action (destructive git, breaking API/schema, security-critical change, invasive migration, or comparable blast radius).

## Entry Template

```md

## Entries

<!-- Append new entries below this line in reverse chronological order. -->

## 2026-02-19T14:25:09Z - realign branch protection to deterministic provider contexts
- action: replace legacy `provider_capability_matrix` required context with explicit provider contexts (`provider_capability_openai`, `provider_capability_anthropic`, `provider_capability_google`) on `main`
- rationale: matrix-style context naming is ambiguous for branch protection; explicit contexts remove merge-gate drift risk
- impacted_files: GitHub repository branch protection settings for `IamNotATuringMachine/DirectStock` (`main`)
- risk_level: high
- expected_impact: branch protection required checks align exactly with CI job identities and remain stable across workflow execution
- result: success
- actual_impact: `main` required checks now use deterministic provider-specific contexts and no longer depend on matrix naming behavior
- rollback_hint: patch branch protection required contexts back to previous list via `gh api repos/IamNotATuringMachine/DirectStock/branches/main/protection/required_status_checks`
- verification:
  - `gh api --method PATCH repos/IamNotATuringMachine/DirectStock/branches/main/protection/required_status_checks --input <payload.json>` -> PASS
  - `./scripts/check_branch_protection.sh` -> PASS

## 2026-02-19T14:13:11Z - synchronize main branch required status contexts
- action: update GitHub branch protection required status checks on `main` to the autonomous UI/UX+Gemini gate set
- rationale: enforce the newly introduced PR-blocking governance/quality gates at repository policy level
- impacted_files: GitHub repository branch protection settings for `IamNotATuringMachine/DirectStock` (`main`)
- risk_level: high
- expected_impact: merges to `main` are blocked unless all required contexts (provider parity, desktop/mobile a11y+visual, token drift, gemini config) pass
- result: success
- actual_impact: `main` required status checks now enforce all new contexts; policy script confirms branch protection is compliant
- rollback_hint: patch branch protection required contexts back to previous set via `gh api repos/IamNotATuringMachine/DirectStock/branches/main/protection/required_status_checks`
- verification:
  - `gh api --method PATCH repos/IamNotATuringMachine/DirectStock/branches/main/protection/required_status_checks --input <payload.json>` -> PASS
  - `./scripts/check_branch_protection.sh` -> PASS

## 2026-02-19T10:48:31Z - enable branch-protection api capability
- action: change repository visibility to public and configure main-branch protection baseline
- rationale: strict branch-protection mode is enabled and requires GitHub Branch Protection API support
- impacted_files: GitHub repository settings, branch protection policy on `main`
- risk_level: critical
- expected_impact: strict branch-protection guard becomes technically satisfiable; repository source becomes publicly accessible
- result: success
- actual_impact: repository is now public, branch-protection API is available, and `main` protection baseline is configured/validated
- rollback_hint: set repository visibility back to private and/or relax strict branch-protection requirement
- verification:
  - `gh repo view IamNotATuringMachine/DirectStock --json visibility,isPrivate` -> PASS (`PUBLIC`, `isPrivate=false`)
  - `gh api repos/IamNotATuringMachine/DirectStock/branches/main/protection` -> PASS
  - `BRANCH_PROTECTION_REQUIRE_SUPPORTED=1 ./scripts/check_branch_protection.sh` -> PASS

## 2026-02-19T09:33:01Z - agent-self-improve autonomous policy update
- action: apply governance/document updates generated by scripts/agent_self_improve.py
- rationale: keep provider parity and recurring-incident feedback loop current
- impacted_files: docs/agents/auto-improvement-backlog.md
- risk_level: medium
- expected_impact: reduced policy drift and faster autonomous recovery
- result: success
- actual_impact: No policy drift detected.
- rollback_hint: revert modified governance/docs files and rerun lint checks
- verification:
  - `python3 scripts/agent_policy_lint.py --strict --provider all --format json` -> PASS
