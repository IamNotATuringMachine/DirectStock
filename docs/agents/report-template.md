# Agent Report Template

Every agent work session should end with a report containing:

1. **Files changed** — list of modified/created/deleted files
2. **Functional change** — what changed and why
3. **Verification and results** — commands run and pass/fail outcomes
4. **Residual risks/open points** — known issues or incomplete items
5. **Optional next 1-3 steps** — recommended follow-up actions
