The gravitational pull exerted by a black hole is governed by the Schwarzschild radius, $R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}$, where the spacetime curvature becomes so infinitely pronounced that even photons traveling at $c$ cannot escape the event horizon, leading to a relativistic time dilation effect that asymptotically approaches infinity from the perspective of an outside observer. Furthermore, the tidal forces acting upon a body approaching the singularity are quantified by the Riemann curvature tensor, resulting in a differential acceleration so extreme that the structural integrity of any baryonic matter is compromised via spaghettification, a process where the radial stretching and tangential compression are dictated by the inverse-cube law of tidal interactions. Consequently, the orbital mechanics of stellar companions are perturbed by the Lense-Thirring effect in Kerr black holes, where the frame-dragging of spacetime itself creates an ergosphere in which the rotational energy of the massive compact object can be extracted via the Penrose process, effectively transforming the gravitational potential into high-energy astrophysical jets.
