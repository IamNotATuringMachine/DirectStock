      "content": "The ball costs **$0.05** (5 cents).\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Define the variables:**\n    *   Let the price of the ball be **$x$**.\n    *   The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball, so the price of the bat is **$x + $1.00**.\n\n2.  **Set up the equation:**\n    *   The total cost is $1.10.\n    *   Ball + Bat = $1.10\n    *   $x + (x + 1.00) = 1.10$\n\n3.  **Solve for $x$:**\n    *   $2x + 1.00 = 1.10$\n    *   Subtract $1.00 from both sides: $2x = 0.10$\n    *   Divide by 2: **$x = 0.05$**\n\n**Verification:**\n*   Ball: $0.05\n*   Bat ($1.00 more): $1.05\n*   Total: $0.05 + $1.05 = **$1.10**",
