      "content": "The ball costs **$0.05** (5 cents).\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Define the variables:**\n    *   Let the cost of the ball be **$x$**.\n    *   Since the bat costs $1.00 more than the ball, the cost of the bat is **$x + $1.00**.\n\n2.  **Set up the equation:**\n    *   The total cost is the ball plus the bat: **$x + ($x + $1.00) = $1.10**.\n\n3.  **Solve for $x$:**\n    *   Combine the $x$ terms: **2$x + $1.00 = $1.10**.\n    *   Subtract $1.00 from both sides: **2$x = $0.10**.\n    *   Divide by 2: **$x = $0.05**.\n\n4.  **Verify the result:**\n    *   If the ball costs **$0.05**, then the bat costs **$1.05** ($0.05 + $1.00).\n    *   Together, $0.05 + $1.05 = **$1.10**, which matches the total cost provided.",
