      "content": "The ball costs **$0.05** (or 5 cents).\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Define the variables:**\n    *   Let the price of the ball be **$x$**.\n    *   Since the bat costs $1.00 more than the ball, the price of the bat is **$x + $1.00**.\n\n2.  **Set up the equation:**\n    *   The total cost of both items is $1.10.\n    *   So: `(Price of Ball) + (Price of Bat) = $1.10`\n    *   `x + (x + 1.00) = 1.10`\n\n3.  **Solve for x:**\n    *   Combine like terms: `2x + 1.00 = 1.10`\n    *   Subtract 1.00 from both sides: `2x = 0.10`\n    *   Divide by 2: **`x = 0.05`**\n\n**Verification:**\n*   **Ball:** $0.05\n*   **Bat:** $1.05 ($0.05 + $1.00)\n*   **Total:** $1.05 + $0.05 = **$1.10**",
